This stuff is getting curiouser and curiouser.  I just
realized that you can also have fully dynamically scoped
aliases, simply be pre-declaring the name as a local. You
don't ever need to use a glob for aliasing with this scheme.

Here's the latest Alias.pm with a significant addition
to the pod, and with the redundant C<eval>s excised.
