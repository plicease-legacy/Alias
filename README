This is the README file for "Alias", the Perl module
that performs aliasing services.

This is Version 2.0-beta.

Perl Version 5.001 or later is required.

You may also need MakeMaker Ver. 5.09 or later (check the
file $PERLSRC/lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker).

You may find this module useful if you:

   * are tired of dereferencing hash-based object attributes

   * wish to use fewer $ and -> signs

   * are a little scared of using typeglobs

   * want the freedom to put what you want, when you want in
     the symbol table

   * need to use constants in your program because you don't
     trust yourself from changing $PI

It would be interesting to benchmark how much less/more efficient C<attr> is
when compared to regular hash access of object attributes under various
degrees of use.

Comments are always very welcome.

-------------------
Installation is via the standard mantra.
The distribution assumes you have dynamic linking available. Type

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test

If the tests pass, you can type

      make install

to install the module.
