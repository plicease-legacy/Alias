HISTORY - release history for Alias

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 8

=item 2.32

No change in functionality.  Added #defines for compatibility with the
5.006 development branch (courtesy Nathan Torkington <gnat@frii.com>).

=item 2.31

save_gp() is now exported from core, so use it instead of our own
version.  Thanks to Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org> for the bug report.

Require 5.004.

=item 2.3

The developer versions after 5.003 broke XSUB call semantics when the
C<-d> switch is used (to invoke debugger or profiler).  The problem is
fixed in versions >= 5.003_19.  Added the necessary logic to make use
of the escape in Alias.xs. Thanks to Josh Purinton <joshp@silmaril.com>
for reporting the problem.  

Objects are not automatically dereferenced by attr().  They are available
as scalars instead, thanks to a feature request from Peter Seibel 
<seibel@organic.com>. ***INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE***

Using attr() in DESTROY subs resulted in deep recursion, fixed.  Thanks
to Helmut Jarausch <jarausch@igpm.rwth-aachen.de>.

=item 2.2

Two new options C<$KeyFilter>, and C<$AttrPrefix> added for controlling
which hash entries are aliased by C<attr>.  This offers one way to avoid
C<use vars> when using C<use strict 'vars';>.

Documentation, testsuite additions.

=item 2.1    

C<attr> now returns the passed value.

We C<require 5.002>.

C<attr> is now prototyped to ($).

*a = \*b work around has been removed (fixed in 5.002)

"private" methods are now supported.

Documentation, testsuite additions.

=item 2.0    

Added implicit localization for C<attr> via XS code.

=item 1.3    

Added C<attr> (unreleased).

=item 1.2    

Bugfix in the while loop, and other cleanup. Thanks to Ian Phillips
<ian@pipex.net>.

=item 1.1

Added named closures to pod.

=item 1.0

Released to perl5-porters@nicoh.com.
