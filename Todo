=item 1.

C<attr> ought to move into perl core when I get around to hacking it in.
Object attributes can then be lexically scoped instead of dynamically,
or both.

=item 2. (nonitem)

You'd think C<const> could be made to work for hashes and arrays via 
XSive code.  But it turns out that the perl source must be heavily
involved.  Using C<tie> to achieve this is probably simpler.
