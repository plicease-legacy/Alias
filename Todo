=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item 1.

C<attr> will move into perl core when the time comes. Object attributes 
can then be lexically scoped instead of dynamically, or both.

=item 2. (nonitem)

You'd think C<const> could be made to work for hashes and arrays via 
XSive code, but it isn't so easy, since the perl source must be
heavily involved.  Using C<tie> to achieve this is probably
simpler.
